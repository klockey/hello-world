          <h3>Old Days</h3>
          <p>
          <span class="blue-text">
            In the old days  (1989) of the web people were constrained by web languages.  Css was
            not around yet so correctly locating the objects of html was done explicitly with
            html tables.  Around 1995, Javascript which was made by Netscape helped make html more
            viable by making it easy to modify the html dynamically.  Flash broke through around
            the same time making it easy to make moving images and clips of movies etc.  Also, Css came around
            about this time as well giving developers a better way of structuring data.

          <h3>Internet of Things</h3>
          <p>
          <span id="yellow-text">
            The internet of things developed in the 2000's.  No longer were people confined
            to sitting at their desktops with a clunky computers.  Now people could use mobile phones,
            tablets, laptops etc.

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
          <span class="blue-text">
            As time progresses web languages will have to be adapted to different machines. It's amazing to
            think html has survived all these years and has been modified for all its
            different uses.  In order for the web to a viable construct in the world it <b> must </b>  be
            flexible and dynamic.
